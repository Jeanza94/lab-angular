  Having a list of n numbers with digits in range [0, S], where n <= 100, switch all list positions in O(n)
  time.
  If the input number contains a digit greater or equal than S, you will delete the digit from the
  number, for example with S=6, 61 becomes 1, and 6 will be deleted from the array. The result
  should be printed in console/terminal. Please, donâ€™t use built-in sort of your language.
